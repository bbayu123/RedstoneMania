RedstoneMania
===============

Redstone Mania features wireless, customizable and instant redstone in the form of 'circuits'. How does that distinct from other plugins like Craftbook you might ask, well, instead of supplying circuitry that are built-in, you can create and save them yourself! Instead of having hundreds of XOR-circuits lined up to make that awesome door lock, you can now save this XOR-circuit and make it instant, small, and persistent.

What it basically allows you to do, is select ports in a (real-world) redstone circuit, configure some of the torches and repeaters to tweak delays, and perform the 'create' command to make a virtual version of that circuit. You can then use port signs to make instances of this circuit in the world. It doesn't stop there, as you can further use these circuits to include in other circuits. You can basically extend the redstone logic to the point you have a working microcontroller. Something that used to be the size of a house, can now be done in just a few blocks.

Additional to all this, the ports of a circuit are wireless. You can place infinite amounts of the same ports all over the **server** (yes, it works between worlds too!). This allows for wireless control of redstone throughout the server.
